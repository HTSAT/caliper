******   Caliper Release 0.1    ******

The test suite mainly includes  performance test
cases, it can be used to test the performance of machine. The test suite supports linux of x86_64, arm_32, arm_64. Here is steps to setup testbed

1. Host OS installation
    It supports x86_64 CentOS6 and Ubuntu platform, you need install 64bit
    CentOS system or Ubuntu system on your PC or server platform.

2. Toolchain installation
    To build arm/android target binary, it requires arm/android toolchain
    deployment, for arm system we use compiler with hard-float ABI. And for
    android toolchain we use android ndk tools.

    Here is website to download ARM toolchains:
        https://releases.linaro.org/13.10/components/toolchain/binaries/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-4.8-2013.10_linux.tar.bz2
    Website link to download android ndk toolchains:
        http://dl.google.com/android/ndk/android-ndk64-r10-linux-x86_64.tar.bz2
    Note: Current test suite can only build for android armv7 platform,
    building for armv8 platform is not supported now.
3. Test case compiling
    Supposing these two directories is for arm/android installation separately:
        /opt/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-4.8-2013.10_linux
        /opt/android-ndk-r9d
    Executing the following script before compiling test suite
        # export PATH=$PATH:/opt/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-4.8-2013.10_linux/bin
        # export ANDROID_NDK_PATH=/opt/android-ndk-r9d
    Executing this script to compile test cases:
        # python install.py x86_64             (building the testsuit for x86_64 platform)
        # python install arm_32             (building the testsuite for armv7 platform)
        # python install arm_64             (building the testsuite for arm64 platform)
    After finished building command, the test cases binary images are saved in
    the following directory:
        # build/x86_64
        # build/arm_32
        # build/arm_64

4. Test case deployment
    Currently the test suite does not support automatically deployment and
    execution, users need copy the test suite to target machine and execute
    the test suite by manual; or cross-compile on the host, and copy execute
    files to the target.

4.1 Executing on ARM system
    On arm server platform such as D01 platform, it requires that x86_64 host
    machine is connected with target board with Ethernet cable.
        1. Copy the test suite located on build/arm to target machine,  *******
           supposing copying to /root/test/ directory
        2. Login arm target board by ssh command
        3. Execute the test cases located at directory /root/test
            # su -
            # cd /root/test
            # ./run.sh
            # ./parser.sh
        4. The test result is saved in the directory of output which locates in
        the build directory.

4.2 Executing on host machine
    Executing the testsuite on x86_64 server platform is simple, just executing
    such commands:
        # cd build/x86
        # su
        # ./run.sh
        # ./parser.sh
    The test result is saved in the directory of output which locates in the build
    directory.
